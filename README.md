# Pandas-Challenge

I am the new Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

techniques that I'll be using to get this data is:

	*Use jupyter notebook files from local directories and connect to my development envirnoment
	*Create Pandas DataFrames
	*Run functions on Pandas DataFrames
	*Read and write DataFrames to and from CSV files with Pandas
	*Create and access Pandas "groupby" objects
	*Sort DataFrames
	*Slicing data using "cut()" method
	*create new values based on a series of bins
	*fix common Python and Pandas bugs in Jupyter Notebook

# **PyCity Schools Analysis

- This data analysis was taken from 39,170 students within 15 schools on their standardized test of math and reading. From these test results of each student/school, it'll help break down comparisons in performance, different grade level and spending upon each school and sizes. It also draws us into understanding needs and trends that that students and school base on which type of school it is. The following, some trends could note base on the data that smaller size school has a more higher performance with lower budget as bigger size school has more of moderate performance.

- **Conclusion/Comparison

  -Comparing the data set of Highest performing school and lowest performing school; some key differences are the types of school, if it's charter or district school. Another thing to note is the budget that was given to each school and how they substantially provide for each student and their testing score on average. We can note that student count in charter school and school size are able to provide higher scores, while for district school  with bigger student count and bigger school size are not performing at the same rate as charter schools.

  - There were irregular finding in this analysis such as with a higher budget per student increases, the averages of math and reading, and passing math and reading decreases. Now is this to say that with bigger budget per student count is used adequately to provide the right learning for students to score better? Or is their other factors such as location:cities and/or districts, negative influence, that affects student achievement.


** Resources that I used to finish this challenge is resources that was provided to me by class resources, from Module 4 "Further Reading and helpful Links", googling up helpful Pandas/Python codes, also in class activites instructions and Xpert Learning Assistant -NEW!
